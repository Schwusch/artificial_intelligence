 * Created by Jonathan BÃ¶cker on 2016-09-12.
 *
 * A somewhat complex data structure, similar to a tree and weighted graph with unlimited and unsorted child nodes.
 * Keeps track of the edges(moves) and vertexes(statenodes) in an {@link ArrayList} of {@link StateChange} objects.
 * On constructing the object, it recursively calculates the best state change(move). This may take a considerable
 * amount of time and resources.
